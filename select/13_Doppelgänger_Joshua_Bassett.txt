I guess I'm not as over you as I thought that I was
I saw someone who looked like you at our favorite coffee shop
And part of me was hoping we would get the chance to talk
I guess I'm not as over you as I thought
I've spent a lot of nights memorizing lines
Thinking 'bout what I might say
And, after all this time, I'm still fight or flight
I can't help but run away
I know we're getting older
We're moving on and over
But everywhere I go, I see your face
I guess I'm not as over you as I thought that I was
I saw someone who looked like you at our favorite coffee shop
And part of me was hoping we would get the chance to talk
I guess I'm not as over you as I thought
And I thought I was, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, I thought I was, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She wore your yellow dress, same as when we met
I couldn't believe my eyes
Even when I left, I was still a wreck
Tryna find the reason why
I'm scared to death to see ya
But I wanted it to be ya
And worst of all, I don't even know why
I guess I'm not as over you as I thought that I was
I saw someone who looked like you at our favorite coffee shop
And part of me was hoping we would get the chance to talk
I guess I'm not as over you as I thought
And I thought I was, ooh-ooh-ooh
And I thought I was, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
The truth is, no one's like you
And a heart cannot be lied to
A look-alike could never take your place
I guess I'm not as over you as I thought that I was
I saw someone who looked like you at our favorite coffee shop
And part of me was hoping we would get the chance to talk
I guess I'm not as over you as I thought
No, I guess I'm not as over you as I thought
No, I guess I'm not as over you as I thought
And I thought I was
